# Obsidian Notes

Publish your public notes with MkDocs

## Hello World!

The `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.

The folders in `/docs` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.

The notes appear as pages within these sections. For example, [[Note 1]] in `Topic 1`

<table>
	<tr>
		<th> Good </th>
		<th> Bad </th>
	</tr>
